# Find TOTP codes that all have the same number

This code can help you figure out when your two-factor authentication app will show some cool numbers, like "000000", "111111", "999999", or even "123456. The possibilities are endless \*

Run `bundle install`, then `./totp_finder.rb`. Then you can import `totp_ical.ics` into your Google Calendar! (Maybe create a separate calendar for these events, so you can delete them easily.)
